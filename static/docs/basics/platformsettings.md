# Platform Settings

------------

In Blossom Essentials, you can edit the behaviour of the server depending on what platform you are, like straight-up banning people, or finding the platform they are with Command Blocks.

------------

## Banning a platform

To ban a platform, you need to navigate to Main Settings > Platform Settings, then click the platform you want to ban. You must kick all of the players that are on the platform for it to come in effect.

(Will fix in 0.1.4)

---------------------

## Command syntax

The platform tags start with `platform_` then the platform the player is on. Example: `platform_console`

**Example command:**

`tag @a[tag=platform_console] add "Console Player"`
